# Simple MLS Protocol Demonstration

This project is developed as part of the Applied Cryptography course and aims to demonstrate the basic functioning of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol. The application simulates a secure group messaging environment where users can join, leave, and communicate securely using the MLS protocol.
Features

    - Group Creation: Users can create secure messaging groups.
    - User Management: Users can join and leave groups dynamically.
    - Message Encryption: All messages are encrypted using the MLS protocol.
    - Key Rotation: The application supports key rotation to maintain forward secrecy.

# Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is educational, providing a hands-on understanding of how the MLS protocol works in practice. This includes key management, group membership dynamics, and message encryption, which are crucial for building secure communication systems.
Usage

    - Start the application and create a new group.
    - Invite other users to join the group.
    - Send encrypted messages within the group.
    - Observe the protocol handling key changes when users join or leave the group.
